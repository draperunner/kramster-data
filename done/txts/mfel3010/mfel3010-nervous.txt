Q
3
What is correct about excitation contraction coupling?
O
The action potential causes inflow of Na+ intracellularly, which binds to tubulin
O
The action potential causes inflow of Na+ intracellularly, which binds to troponin
O
The action potential causes intracellular release of Ca++,which binds to tubulin
O
The action potential causes intracellular release of Ca++, which binds to troponin.

Q
1
What is the function of the sodium-potassium pump?
O
Transporting potassium and Sodium across the cell membrane from low to high concentration by utilizing the membrane potential
O
Transporting potassium and Sodium across the cell membrane from low to high concentration by use of energy in the form of ATP
O
Transporting of sodium and potassium from high to low concentration by facilitated diffusion.
O
Equalize extracellular and intracellular concentration of Sodium and Potassium.

Q
1
What is the result of the process which is the function of the sodium-potassium pump?
O
Utilizing the concentration gradient of sodium and potassium for synthesis of ATP.
O
The concentration gradient of potassium lead to a diffusion of potassium that is not followed by anionic diffusion, and this builds up a membrane potential
O
As the concentration differences of potassium and sodium across the cell membrane are removed (equalized), the differences in protein anions will create a membrane potential.
O
As the intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium becomes equal, the membrane potential is determined by the concentration of calcium.

Q
1
Where is the regulatory centre for respiration situated in the nervous system?
O
The sympathetic ganglia
O
The brain stem
O
The cerebellum
O
The basal ganglia

Q
2
Where in the central nervous system is pulse and blood pressure controlled?
O
The cerebral cortex
O
The cerebellum
O
The brainstem
O
The spinal cord

Q
2
What is the function of myelin sheaths around nerve axons?
O
Nutrition
O
Mechanical support
O
Increasing signal conduction
O
Protection against infection

Q
2
What are synapses?
O
Synapses are support cells which works as the maintenance and immune cells of the nervous system
O
Synapses are specialized nerve cells, whose primary function is transmission of the fast signal activity throughout the nervous system
O
Synapses are places of contact between a nerve cell and another cell (nerve cells, muscle cells or glandular cells).
O
Synapses are extensions of support cells that establish intimate contact with nerve cell axons to facilitate impulse conduction.

Q
2
What is correct about an action potential?
O
An action potential is triggered by an increase in calcium in the extracellular fluid
O
An action potential is triggered by an increase in calcium in the cytoplasm
O
An action potential is triggered by a partial depolarisation of the cell membrane.
O
An action potential is triggered by a patrial hyperpolarisation f the cell membrane

Q
1
In the situation called “fight or flight response” one part of the peripheral nervous system is activated even before action starts. Which?
O
The parasympathetic system
O
The sympathetic system
O
The somatic motor neurons
O
The somatic sensory neurons
