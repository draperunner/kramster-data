As the intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium becomes equal, the membrane potential is determined by the concentration of calcium.

You happen to be admitted to the cardiology department for chest pain and palpitations (a noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat due to agitation, exertion, or illness) and is being examined by Dr. Asbjørn Heart, a consultant in cardiology. Upon completion of the examination, he uses an Electronic health record system to prepare a clinical note. You suffer from atrial fibrillation. You are put on a anticoagulant (a substance having the effect of retarding or inhibiting the coagulation of the blood), discharged from the hospital the next day, and scheduled for a follow- up with Dr. Heart within three weeks.
Five days later, you develop a nose bleeding (that might be related to the use of the anticoagulant). You rush to visit your primary care physician (fastlege). He queries his primary care EHR-system, but cannot find any discharge letter from the hospital, and is not aware that you are using an anticoagulant. He seeks to find out by making a phone call to Dr. Heart.
Which of the following clinical purposes of Electronic health record (EHR) systems applies to the situation of your primary care physician?
O
EHR systems shall facilitate the clinical care of individual patients by making information available to others with access to the record system who are involved in the care of the same patients.

Q
D
The cut off limits between anemia and normal hemoglobin are usually set at 12 g/dl for women and 13 g/dl for men.

He checks his records and at the last check up visit, the hemoglobin was 14.2. The doctor prescribes iron medication due to the drop in the value, in order to prevent development of anemia. This decision is:

Correct, as the drop in hemoglobin obviously shows iron deficiency or iron loss
O
Correct anyway, everybody should take iron supplements, as the normal food in any case contains too little iron.
O
Incorrect, because the value does not fulfill the definition of anemia
