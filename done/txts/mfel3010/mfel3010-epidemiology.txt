can only become too large

will not change if the study is large enough

Q
3
Compared to cohort studies, what is a major limitation of the case-control design in the study of a causal relation between a factor (= exposure) and a disease (= outcome)?
O
A case-control study is more expensive and takes longer time
O
There may be bias (= systematic error) in the measured presence or absence of the suspected factor (exposure)
O
There may be bias (= systematic error) in the measured presence or absence of the resulting outcome (disease)
O
It is difficult to identify (ascertain/skaffe) appropriate controls

Q

The association between hypertension (high blood pressure) and stroke was examined in a cohort study. The study showed that the relative risk of stroke was 3 among people with hypertension, compared with people without hypertension. What is the correct interpretation of this result?
O
People with hypertension had a 3 times higher probability of getting a stroke, compared with people without hypertension.
O
When people with hypertension got a stroke, they had a 3 times higher probability of dying from the disease, compared with people without hypertension.
O
The prevalence of stroke was 3 times higher among people with hypertension, compared with people without hypertension.
O
The brain area affected in stroke patients was on average 3 times larger in people with hypertension, compared with people without hypertension.

Q
2
Epidemiological studies shows that heart patients with an oxygen uptake of < 17 ml/kg/min has a 10 year mortality of about 50% (Survival of 50%). Heart patients with oxygen uptake of > 28 ml/kg min on the other hand, has a 10 year mortality of only 20% (survival of 80%). Interval training has been shown to be the most efficient way of increasing oxygen uptake, and increases the Oxygen uptake most. Studies at the NTNU have shown that high intensity interval training is feasible in all kinds of heart patients. In addition, it reduces risk factors most. Does that mean that interval training is the most efficient way of increasing survival in heart patients?
O
Yes, interval training increases maximum oxygen uptake most, and thus increases survival most
O
Yes, Interval training reduces risk factors the most, and thus reduces mortality risk (increases survival) the most.
O
No, even if risk factors and oxygen uptake improves, is that no proof of improved survival
O
No, hard training will increase risk of training related deaths, and thus increase mortality (reduce survival).

Q
2
A certain clinical study shows treatment 1 to be better to reduce the mortality (number of deaths) than treatment 2 for a certain disease with a p value (significance) of 10%. What does this mean?
O
The probability of dying of the disease with treatment 1 is 10% lower than with treatment 2
O
The number needed to treat the disease with treatment 1 instead of treatment 2, in order to reduce the number of deaths by one patient, is 10
O
The difference may be real, with a probability of 90%
O
The difference may be real, but only with a probability of 10%

Q
2
The results of the study above were a little disappointing, as we like the significance level of a clinical study to be below 5% for the result to be useful. So the study power was calculated, and was found to be only 70% for the patient number and desired significance level of
5%. What does that mean?
O
That only 70% of the patients would profit from treatment 1 over treatment 2
O
That 70% of the patients would survive with treatment 1, as opposed to only 30% with treatment 2
O
That there was only 70% probability of achieving a p value of 5%, even if the difference was real
O
That there was only 30% probability that the difference was real

Q
2
Aclinical study of a certain disease, comparing treatment A with treatment B, found a difference in mortality between treatment A and treatment B (A< B) with a significance of <1%. What does that mean?
O
That the mortality is reduced by ≥ 1% with treatment A compared to B
O
That the study strength was 99%
O
That this finding was almost certainly real (with a probability of ≥ 99%)
O
That this finding was almost certainly random (with a probability of ≥ 99%)

Q

O
The number needed to treat the disease with treatment 1 instead of treatment 2, in order to reduce the number of deaths by one patient, is 5
O

O
That 70% of the patients would survive with treatment 1, as opposed to only 30% with treatment 2

O
Practice that is founded in solid physiological experiments as evidence
O
Practice that is only founded in clinical studies
O
Practice that takes into account both clinical studies, medical background knowledge and patients experience and preferences
O
Practice that is founded on large epidemiological studies

O
The study is approved by the ethical committee
O
The study has a built in quality check system

Q

The study is under powered by a factor of 5%
