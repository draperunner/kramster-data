Artificial intelligence was born when Alan Turing formulated the Turing Test. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Early advances in artificial intelligence were met with skepticism and doubt. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
The agent function maps percept sequences to action. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
The real world is fully observable. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
A taxi driving from A to B in traffic operates in a deterministic environment. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
A simple reflex agent has a small but limited short-term memory. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Goal-based agents often rely on search and planning to find their goal. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
A utility-based agent is better suited in the real world than a learning agent, since it is able to estimate its own utility. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Learning is necessary for complex agent behaviour to arise in a multi-agent setting. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Learning helps in a stochastic and continuous environment. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
Intelligent agents are supposed to optimize their performance measure. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
The vacuum world is not a toy problem. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Redundant paths in a search tree are impossible to avoid. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
GRAPH-SEARCH is the same as TREE-SEARCH, only with history. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
Time complexity and space complexity are the two best ways to evaluate the performance of an algorithm. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Blind search is also known as heuristic search. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
A graph with branching factor b and depth d can be solved in most cases by uninformed search. §§ 1 §§ True §§ False
Bidirectional search reduces the time complexity with the square root. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
An heuristic estimates the cheapest cost from one node to the goal node, even if the path is impossible to execute. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
A* is the best known form of best-first search. §§ 0 §§ True §§ False
