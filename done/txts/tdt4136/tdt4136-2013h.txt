Which one of these does a rule-based agent system (like the one on a classical expert system) have in its agent function?
O
Contention scheduling algorithm
O
Conflict resolution algorithm

Q
1
In a rule based system, when there are more than one rules that match the current situation and when the agent wants to explore a new/different (than the one in focus last time) hypothesis, the agent prefers the rule that has in its left side (of the a -> b) elements that are most recently updated in the working memory of the agent.
O
True
O

The first phase of GraphPlan can be used as a heuristic function for forward search in the following way: Given a state s and goal g, run the graph-construction phases of GraphPlan until all the components are present and not mutex in the last layer. Let n be the number of action layers in the graph. We can let n be the heuristic value for s. Is this an admissible heuristic?
O
True
O
False

Frame-based representation is mainly a declarative representation.

Q
1
Spreading activation and inheritance are main mechanisms of inference in rule-based systems.
O
True

Turing test measures the utility of an agent.
O
True
O
False

Q
1
In a rule-based system, backward chaining works best when the rules have complex consequent structures.
O
True

N-gram character model is a natural language model.

False

Q
1
Sufficient and necessary conditions are inference rules for sound reasoning.
O
True
O
False

Q
1
Greedy Best-First search using the heuristic h(n) = 0 for all states n, is guaranteed to find an optimal solution.
O
True
O
False
EXPLANATION
Since all nodes will have f(n)=0, result will in general depend on how ties are broken

Q

If h1 and h2 are both admissible heuristics, it is always preferable to use the heuristic h3(n) = max(h1(n), h2(n)) over the heuristic h4(n) = min(h1(n), h2(n)).
O
True
O
False

Q
1
If h1 is an admissible heuristic and h2 is not an admissible heuristic, (h1 + h2)/2 must be an admissible heuristic.
O
True
O
False
