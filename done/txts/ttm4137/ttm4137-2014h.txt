Q
0
Why can the UICC be physically separated from the rest of the UE device?
O
The UE manufacturing and lifecycle can be managed independently from the personalization and subscription process
O
The UICC holds an expiration date and, like credit cards, must be replaced
O
The failure rate of the integrated circuit cards (UICCs) are high because the issuers (mobile operators) want to optimize cost against subscription duration
O
The manufacturer plugs a special key-card into the UICC interface slot for key distribution and software management

Q
2
What is the difference between a checksum code and a cryptographic message authentication code?
O
There is no difference, they are only different terms for the same primitive
O
A message authentication code can be used to construct a checksum code, but not the other way around
O
A checksum can be (re-)computed by an attacker, the authentication code cannot
O
A keyed checksum provides stronger message integrity protection than a message authentication code
