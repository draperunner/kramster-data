Q
1
Is the UMTS/LTE network domain security specifications for the core network sufficient to protect the authentication and key agreement messages against parallel session attacks
O
No, the network domain security does not necessarily protect the session identifier, but this cannot be exploited by an attacker
O
No, the network domain security does not necessarily protect the session identifier and may allow session-mixup attacks
O
Yes, the network domain specification demands the use of IPsec or MAPsec, and therefore the core network communication is protected
O
Yes, but the core network communication is always assumed to be secure, independent of the network domain security specifications

Q
2
What is the problem with MAC Sequence Number Analysis in Intrusion Detection Systems?
O
The MAC Sequence Number Analysis does not work at all because the sequence numbers are not integrity protected
O
The MAC Sequence Numbers only protect against message replay attacks, but not against session hijacking
O
Each class in QoS (WMM) has its own sequence number. Also an attacker can still hijack a session when the victim goes offline
O
Implementations very often use a constant value as MAC Sequence Number, and, therefore, this does not even protect against replay attacks

Q
2
What is the difference between a checksum code and a cryptographic message authentication code?
O
There is no difference, they are only different terms for the same primitive
O
A message authentication code can be used to construct a checksum code, but not the other way around
O
A checksum can be (re-)computed by an attacker, the authentication code cannot
O
A keyed checksum provides stronger message integrity protection than a message authentication code

Q
1
Why is it not sufficient to construct a one-way function \(y = f(x)\) based on an NP-hard problem?
O
The one-way property requires that the problem is NP-complete and not just NP-hard
O
NP-hardness guarantees only that there exists a y for which a x is hard to compute
O
A one-way function must satisfy the property of collision-resistance too
O
Computing a preimage must be hard in the worst case
