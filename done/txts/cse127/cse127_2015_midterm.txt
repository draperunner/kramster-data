Q
1
A one-way hash function provides the property that there is only one way to verify if it is correct (i.e., using the correct cryptographic key).
O
True
O
False

Q
1
A major advantage of public key cryptography over shared key cryptography is that key distribution is not required.
O
True
O
False

Q
1
The strength of a cryptographic key is determined by its length in bits.
O
True
O
False

Q
0
Randomly selected passwords offer protection against dictionary attacks.
O
True
O
False

Q
0
A side channel is a flaw in the implementation of a system that allows secret information to be inferred even though it is not directly exposed via the system's normal interface.
O
True
O
False

Q
0
Marking the memory in the heap as being non-executable (aka DEP) would protect against heap spray attacks.
O
True
O
False

Q
1
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol protects against Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
O
True
O
False

Q
0
For Bob to send a confidential message to Alice using public key cryptography requires that
O
Bob knows Alice's public key
O
Bob knows Alice's private key
O
Alice knows Bob's private key
O
Alice knows Bob's public key

Q
1
In a system with 20 computers, each of whom may need to send confidential messages to each other, how many unique public keys must each computer maintain to support this capability?
O
20
O
19
O
9
O
10

Q
3
Suppose you wish to encrypt your own credit card number (16 numeric digits) using a standard block cipher such as AES (let's say using 256 bits key size and a 128 bits block size). What mode should you use the block cipher in?
O
ECB mode
O
CBC mode
O
CFB mode
O
Any of these will be equally good

Q
2
A nonce is used to protect against what kind of attack in a cryptographic protocol?
O
Tampering
O
Eavesdropping
O
Replay
O
Denial-of-Service

What are the assumptions under which stack cookies are effective at stopping buffer overflow attacks?
O
The value of the stack cookie is secret
O
The attacker must overflow the stack contiguously (i.e., they can not "skip" bytes)
O
The stack cookie is at least as large as the largest buffer on the stack
O
All functions validate stack cookies on function return
O
All functions validate stack cookies on function entry
O
The stack cookie is properly salted

Q
0 1 4
What are the assumptions under which Address Space Layout Randomization (ALSR) is effective at stopping buffer overflow attacks?
O
The layout of memory is secret
O
Attackers need to redirect control flow to a particular address they control
O
The stack is arranged to be lower in memory than the heap
O
All memory pointers are encrypted in memory
O
The attacker is unable to read the contents of memory
